# ProductSpecTemp
This repository implements a demo for learning product graphs by recovering three factor graphs from a stream of product graph signals. In the case of finding its contents useful for your research work, kindly please cite the following paper. Thanks a lot for your attention.

[Einizade, Aref, and Sepideh Hajipour Sardouie. "Learning Product Graphs from Spectral Templates." arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.02893 (2022).](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02893)

The codes were written in MATLAB 2018b, and the [GSPBOX](https://epfl-lts2.github.io/gspbox-html/) and [UNLocBoX](https://epfl-lts2.github.io/unlocbox-html/) toolboxes are also needed to run this demo.

## Run `Demo_ProdSpecTemp.m` to generate the desired results. 

Thanks a lot for your attention.
